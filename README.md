## Project Description

### Overview 
The Library Store System is a console-based application developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It simulates real-world operations, and it simulates a hybrid system that combines both library operations and basic e-commerce/store management functionalities.

- Apply core **OOP concepts** including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- Design and implement a **hybrid system** that blends both library and e-commerce functionalities.
- Utilize **modular architecture** to separate UI logic (screens), core business models (entities), and utilities.
- Practice **input validation**, **file handling**, and layered system design in a real-world context.

## Tools and Framework
- **C++**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **File I/O**
